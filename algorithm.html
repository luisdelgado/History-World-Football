            <h1>The Algorithm</h1>
            <p><b>Relevance</b> in World Football History is an algorithm that provides a number on a card that suggests a player's importance in world football history. The algorithm can be applied to each football player who played between 1872 and the present day.</p>           
            <p>Relevance <b>IS NOT</b> a measure of a player's ability.</p>
            </br>
            <h2>Cards Colors</h2>
            <p><b>Black</b> indicates the most important player. (with year): most important player of a year.</p>
            <p><b>White</b> indicates retired players.</p>
            <p><b>Red</b> indicates the player is on the rise due to momentum or reaching a milestone. Relevance can change throughout the year, up or down.</p>
            <p><b>Yellow</b> indicates the algorithm is running with weight adjusted to focus on the current year. He is one of the most important player of the year. (with year): specific year.</p>
            <p><b>Gray</b> indicates the algorithm is running with weight adjusted to focus on the current year. He is in second level of the most importants players of the year. (with year): specific year.</p>
